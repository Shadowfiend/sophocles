# Sophocles

Sophocles is a re-imagining of our approach to writing tutorial
blogs. Typically, we see text interspersed with code. It can be hard to
focus on the changes, sometimes, or to see them out of context. With
Sophocles, I realized that git was an ideal tool for describing sets of
changes. With some small adjustments to how we use git itself, we can
make the elements of a set of git commits a tutorial.

When using Sophocles, every commit is one “step” in your tutorial. The
changes in the commit are the changes for that step, and the commit
message is the description of what those changes do. Sophocles then
formats these in a way that is easy to read.

Sophocles is a Node.js application. The intent is for it to be easily
deployed to heroku so anyone can run a Sophocles blog. Not quite there
yet, but work is ongoing in my spare time!
